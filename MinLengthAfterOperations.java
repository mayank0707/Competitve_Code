/*
You are given a string s.

You can perform the following process on s any number of times:
Choose an index i in the string such that there is at least one character to the left of index i that is equal to s[i], and at least one character to the right that is also equal to s[i].
Delete the closest character to the left of index i that is equal to s[i].
Delete the closest character to the right of index i that is equal to s[i].
Return the minimum length of the final string s that you can achieve.
